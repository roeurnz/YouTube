# ðŸš¨ YouTube Monetization Update (Effective July 15, 2025)

### Current Requirements (unchanged):

* 1,000 subscribers
* 4,000 watch hours
* 2-step verification
* Advanced features enabled
* No active Community Guideline strikes

### Whatâ€™s Changing:

* **Stricter monetization rules** â€” Only **original, human-driven content** will be eligible.
* Many channels relying on automation or repurposed content risk **demonetization**.

### Content **NOT Eligible** (unless heavily modified):

* Slideshows with stock images + background music
* AI-generated videos without narration or editing
* Auto-voiced news/story videos
* Reaction videos without commentary/education
* Compilations of TikToks/Reels/social clips without added value
* Mass-produced, faceless, repetitive content

### What Counts as **Original Content**:

* Human input: **voiceovers, narration, commentary, creative scriptwriting, editing**
* Personalized AI use: rewrite scripts, customize visuals, add human storytelling
* Significant creative transformation (not just cutting clips or adding music)

### Practical Tips to Stay Monetized:

âœ… Use AI only as a helper, not the whole content maker
âœ… Add your **voice, personality, and insights**
âœ… Rewrite or reframe AI scripts in your own tone
âœ… Go beyond basic editing â†’ add context, story, education, or originality

### Other Change (July 15, 2025):

* **YouTube Shorts with music â†’ revenue split with music rights holders**, so creators earn less.

ðŸ‘‰ **Bottom Line:** YouTube now rewards **authentic, creative, human-driven content** â€” not automated content factories.
